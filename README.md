# whiffy-containers
custom containers I run

## fileflows
Custom version of fileflows with some "dockermods" baked into the image because I didn't like the OS drift the dockermods were causing as well as the long startup of compiling av1an.

## mineru
Just bundling the api in a container without vllm
